This Library Information System is the relational database schema of the library services of an academic institute. 
Here, we consider a library having books to be issued by the faculty and students of the institute. 
The library needs an LIS to manage the books, the members, and the issue-return process.
Certain rules have to be followed in the LIS:
  ● There are different book titles, each having a unique ISBN.
  ● Each title may exist in multiple copies (each having a different accession number) in the library.
  ● Each book may have multiple authors, but one publisher and one year of publication.
  ● The book copies are issued by the members, who can be a faculty member or a student.
      ● Members are of the following types:
          ● Students having name, roll number, department code, gender, mobile number, date of birth, and degree.
              ● PG: Postgraduate student
              ● UG: Undergraduate student
              ● RS: Research scholar
          ● Faculty having name, employee id, department code, gender, mobile number, and date of joining.
              ● FC
  ● The faculty members and the students belong to various departments.
  ● A book may not be issued to a member if another copy of the same book is already issued to the same member.
  ● Only one member can issue a particular book copy (having a unique accession number). In other words, no book copy may be issued by two members at the same time.
  ● Every member has a maximum quota (depending on the member type) for the number of books she/he can issue for and for the maximum duration she/he can retain a book.
  ● No issue will be done to a member if, at the time of issue, one or more books issued by the member has already exceeded the duration of the issue.
  ● No issue will also be allowed if the quota is exceeded for the member.
  ● The staffs of the library manage the LIS.
