# DBMS
These are my notes from my IIT course, designed to help you learn SQL from the beginner level.
Iâ€™ve organized them to make it easy and practical for anyone starting out with databases and queries.

LIBRARY and SPORTS folders contain sample databases to refer to.
PRACTISE folder contains questions to solve.
QUESTIONS folder contains additional questions for further practice.

This is also helpful in preparation for OPPE exam.
